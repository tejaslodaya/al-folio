### Hello there!

I am Tejas, a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Swiggy, India's largest and most valuable online food ordering and delivery platform. I am part of the storefront, revenue-and-growth and trust-and-safety team solving problems such as homepage recommendations, ads personalization, fraud detection, intelligent discounting and smart notifications. 

I have productionized large-scale machine learning models based on logisitc regression, boosting, L2R, DNN and BERT to accurately sprinkle personalization on top of tens of millions of daily visits in real-time. I also work closely with the platform team to build new features (recently: [tensorflow serving](https://bytes.swiggy.com/deploying-deep-learning-models-at-scale-at-swiggy-tensorflow-serving-on-dsp-ad5da40f7a6c)) and involve in the design and solutioning of platform's capabilities. 

My research interests are divided into two phases, first at the intersection of databases and ML (pre-modeling phase) to accelerate data exploration, data preprocessing and feature engineering and second, at the intersection of systems and ML (post-modeling phase) to serve models at low-latencies in high-throughput environment.
